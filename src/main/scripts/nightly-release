DESCRIPTION='This is the nightly release of the K framework. To install, download and extract the \"Prebuilt K binary\", and follow the instructions in INSTALL.md within the target directory. On Windows, start by installing [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) with Ubuntu, after which you can download and extract the archive by running:\n```\nsudo apt-get install wget\nwget https://github.com/kframework/k/releases/download/nightly-'$COMMIT'/nightly.tar.gz\ntar xvf nightly.tar.gz\n```\nfrom the bash terminal. K requires gcc and other Linux libraries to run, and building on native Windows, Cygwin, or MINGW is not supported.'
